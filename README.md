## Tech stack:

- React
- Redux
- Material-UI

## Notes:

This app is project submission for a freeCodeCamp Front End Library project, [Random Quote Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine). It therefore includes a freeCodeCamp testing unit to see that the project meets the project requirements.

I am also in the process of learning Systems Analysis and Systems Design in my academic studies and will be going over some of the processes to get familiar with the content I am learning.

## Documentation:

[Systems Analysis and Systems Design](https://github.com/martink-rsa/Random-Quote-Machine/wiki).

## How to Start/Run:

`npm install`

`npm start`

If you wish to disable the freeCodeCamp testing unit, remove the following line from the `index.html` file:

```
